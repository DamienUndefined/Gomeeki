Gomeeki Mini Project
=======

The project is based on Symfony2.6 Framework.
I could work with another framework such as CodeIgniter or Silex, lighter than Symfony but I'm more accustomed to Symfony development and the project will never be in production, so... :).

For this project, I used Doctrine, with db generation from code (code first).

Regarding the architecture, I wanted it simple while trying to keep a layer separation.
I've decided to separate controllers, business object layer and the data layer.

I also used 2 bundles (1 for TwitterAPI and the other one to get geocode datas from the location).

In a real project environment I should add logging, error handling and unit test.

If you want to talk about my development, why, how or something else, do not hesitate to back to me, I'll be glad to talk about technic :).
